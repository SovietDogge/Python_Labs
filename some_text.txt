Web scraping is an important skill for data scientists. I have developed a number of ad hoc web scraping projects using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Scrapy in the past few years and read a few books and tons of online tutorials along the way. However, I have not found a simple beginner level tutorial that is end-to-end in the sense that covers all basic steps and concepts in a typical Scrapy web scraping project (therefore Minimalist in the title) — that’s why I am writing this and hope the code repo can serve as a template to help jumpstart your web scraping projects.

Many people ask: should I use BeautifulSoup or Scrapy? They are different things: BeautifulSoup is a library for parsing HTML and XML and Scrapy is a web scraping framework. You can use BeautifulSoup instead of Scrapy build-in selectors if you want but comparing BeautifulSoup to Scrapy is like comparing the Mac keyboard to the iMac or a better metaphor as stated in the official documentation “like comparing jinja2 to Django” if you know what they are :) — In short, you should learn Scrapy if you want to do serious and systematic web scraping.
